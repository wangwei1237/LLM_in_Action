In this chapter, a brief survey of multi-agent systems has been presented. These encompass different attributes such as architecture, communication, coordination strategies, decision making and learning abilities. The goal of this chapter is to provide a quick reference to assist in the design of multi-agent systems and to highlight the merit and demerits of the existing methods.",
